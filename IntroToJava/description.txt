Euro Trip:
You need to calculate the price of a given quantity of "wurst" in Deutsche Marks. Read the quantity as a double value and print the price in marks, given the following:
•	The price of 1 kg wurst is 1.20 BGN
•	The exchange rate is 4210500000000 DM : 1 BGN 
Print the price, rounded to the second digit after the decimal separator.

Transport Price:
A student travels n kilometers using only one type of transport based on the distance that he will travel:
•	Taxi: Initial tax: 0.70 USD. Daytime cost: 0.79 USD/km. Night time cost: 0.90 USD/km.
•	Bus: Day / Night tariff: 0.09 USD/km. For at least 20 kilometers.
•	Train: Day / Night tariff: 0.06 USD/km. For at least 100 kilometers.
Write a program that calculates the price of the trip by a given distance and time of day.
Format the output to the second digit after the decimal separator.

Product of Numbers [N..M]:
Write a program that calculates the product of all numbers in the interval [n..m] by given n and m

Lottery:
Print all combinations from TOTO 3/10 lottery (like 6/49 but with less combinations)

Extract Bit from Integer:
Write a program that extracts from given positive integer n the value of given bit at index p. The bits are counted from right to left, starting from bit 0.

Modify a Bit:
We are given a positive integer number n, a position p and a bit value v (v=0 or 1). Write a program that modifies n to hold the value v at the position p from the binary representation of n while preserving all other bits in n. 
Print the decimal representation of the resulting number.
